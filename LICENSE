As stated in the README file:

"We extracted and posted the 6502 code because it was a piece of computer history 
that could be of interest to others, and because if we hadn't, it might have been 
lost for all time. We did this for fun, not profit. As the author and copyright 
holder of this source code, I personally have no problem with anyone studying it,
modifying it, attempting to run it, etc. Please understand that this does NOT 
constitute a grant of rights of any kind in Prince of Persia, which is an ongoing 
Ubisoft game franchise. Ubisoft alone has the right to make and distribute Prince 
of Persia games....if you have questions -- technical, legal, or otherwise -- I 
recommend that you direct them to the community at large, whose collective knowledge 
and expertise far exceeds mine, and will only increase as more people get their 
eyes on this code."
